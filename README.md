## Project Overview
Vehicle Breakdown Assistance is an Android application designed to help vehicle owners connect with nearby service stations in case of a vehicle breakdown.  
The app uses Google Maps to detect the user's current location and display the nearest service centers and fuel stations.  
It allows users to request help quickly and efficiently during emergencies such as engine failure, flat tires, or fuel shortage.
